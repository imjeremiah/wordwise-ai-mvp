### Status Key

`[ ]` Not Started  `[~]` In Progress  `[X]` Completed  `[!]` Blocked

*Every sub-feature is independent, testable in isolation, and safe to roll back without breaking other functionality.*

## Phase 2 Progress Summary

**MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS:**
✅ **WordWise AI Data Models** - Complete with automatic word counting, TTL cleanup
